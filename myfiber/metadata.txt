email=hello@correlate.at

about=myfiber provides access to a generic API for fiber broadband services in Austria using a REST based https/json Interface.

  Any request requires a valid API Token. API Tokens are provided by fiber infrastructure providers: noegig, bbrg

  Even if access to the content requires a valid Token, the code might be useful for similar projects where Token based access is required.
